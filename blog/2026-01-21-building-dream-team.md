They say your team makes or breaks your startup. After building Cyfamod with what I consider the most awesome team any founder could ask for, I can confirm: **they're absolutely right.**

But here's the thing nobody tells you: finding great people when you're a scrappy startup with limited resources is hard. Really hard.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Reality: We're Lean (Really Lean)

Let me be honest about our team size: we're small. Like, "everyone wears multiple hats" small.

But what we lack in numbers, we make up for in:
- **Passion** - Everyone believes in the mission
- **Versatility** - No task is "not my job"
- **Ownership** - Each person treats Cyfamod like their own company

## How We Found Each Other

### The First Hire: A Leap of Faith

Our first team member wasn't someone with a perfect resume. They were someone who:
- Understood the problem we were solving
- Asked smart questions about our approach
- Showed up with ideas, not just skills

**Lesson learned:** Hire for attitude and aptitude, not just experience. Skills can be taught; passion and drive cannot.

### The Developer Who Saved Us

We needed a backend developer. Our budget? Let's just say it wasn't competitive with big tech.

We found someone who:
- Was excited about open source
- Wanted to build something meaningful
- Valued equity and growth over a big salary

They've since become our technical backbone. Not because they knew everything, but because they were willing to learn everything.

### The Designer Who "Got It"

Finding a designer who understood both aesthetics and user experience was crucial. Schools need software that's beautiful AND functional.

We found ours through:
- Open source contributions (they'd designed for other projects)
- A shared belief in accessible design
- A portfolio that showed they could make complex systems simple

## What Makes Our Team Special

### 1. **We're Brutally Honest**

No sugarcoating. If something isn't working, we say it. If someone's struggling, we help.

This transparency has saved us from:
- Building features nobody wants
- Letting small problems become big ones
- Burning out in silence

### 2. **Everyone Owns Something**

We don't have "managers" and "workers." We have owners:
- Someone owns the student management module
- Someone owns the fee tracking system
- Someone owns the parent communication features

Ownership creates accountability and pride in work.

### 3. **We Celebrate Small Wins**

Launched a new feature? We celebrate.  
Fixed a critical bug? We celebrate.  
Got positive feedback from a school? We celebrate.

In a startup, you can't wait for the "big win" to feel accomplished. Small wins keep morale high.

### 4. **We Protect Each Other's Time**

With a lean team, burnout is a real threat. We've implemented:
- No meetings after 4 PM
- "Deep work" blocks where interruptions are forbidden
- Mandatory time off (yes, mandatory)

A burned-out team ships nothing.

## The Challenges of Being Lean

Let's not romanticize it—being lean is hard:

### **Wearing Too Many Hats**
Our backend developer also handles DevOps. Our designer also does user research. I (the founder) also do customer support.

It's exhausting. But it's also taught us to prioritize ruthlessly.

### **Knowledge Silos**
When only one person knows how something works, that's a risk. We combat this with:
- Pair programming sessions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Cross-training on critical systems

### **Imposter Syndrome**
When you're a small team competing with established players, doubt creeps in. "Are we good enough?"

We remind ourselves: **We're not trying to be them. We're trying to be better for our users.**

## What We Look For in New Team Members

As we grow (slowly), here's our hiring philosophy:

### **Must-Haves:**
1. **Self-starters** - We can't hold hands; we need people who figure things out
2. **Communicators** - Remote work requires over-communication
3. **Mission-aligned** - You have to care about improving education
4. **Humble learners** - Nobody knows everything; everyone should want to learn

### **Nice-to-Haves:**
1. Experience with our tech stack (Next.js, Laravel)
2. Previous startup experience
3. Open source contributions
4. Education sector knowledge

Notice the order? Attitude over aptitude, always.

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Culture is Built, Not Declared**
We don't have a fancy "culture deck." Our culture emerged from:
- How we treat each other during crises
- What we celebrate and what we criticize
- Who we choose to work with

### **2. Diversity of Thought Matters**
We're a small team, but we're diverse in:
- Technical backgrounds (frontend, backend, design, product)
- Life experiences
- Problem-solving approaches

This diversity makes us stronger.

### **3. Equity is Powerful**
Everyone on our team has equity. When Cyfamod succeeds, we all succeed.

This alignment of incentives has created a team that thinks like owners, not employees.

### **4. Remote Can Work**
We're a distributed team. It's not perfect, but it's allowed us to:
- Hire the best people, regardless of location
- Reduce overhead costs
- Offer flexibility that big companies can't match

## To Future Team Members

If you're reading this and thinking about joining a startup like ours, here's what you should know:

**It won't be easy.** You'll work harder than you ever have.  
**It won't be glamorous.** You'll do tasks "beneath" your title.  
**It won't be stable.** Startups are inherently risky.

But if you want:
- **Impact** - Your work will directly affect thousands of students
- **Growth** - You'll learn more in a year than most do in five
- **Ownership** - Your ideas will shape the product
- **Purpose** - You'll build something that matters

Then maybe we're the team for you.

## Final Thoughts

I didn't set out to build the "perfect" team. I set out to build a team that could build Cyfamod.

What I ended up with is better than I could have imagined:
- People who challenge me
- People who cover my weaknesses
- People who believe in the mission as much as I do

We're lean. We're scrappy. We're not perfect.

But we're exactly the team Cyfamod needs.
